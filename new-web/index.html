        Ricinus communis, the castorbean or castor-oil-plant, is a species of perennial flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It is the sole species in the monotypic genus, Ricinus, and subtribe, Ricininae. The evolution of castor and its relation to other species are currently being studied using modern genetic tools. It reproduces with a mixed pollination system which favors selfing by geitonogamy but at the same time can be an out-crosser by anemophily (wind pollination) or entomophily (insect pollination).

        Its seed is the castor bean, which, despite its name, is not a true bean. Castor is indigenous to the southeastern Mediterranean Basin, Eastern Africa, and India, but is widespread throughout tropical regions (and widely grown elsewhere as an ornamental plant).

        Castor seed is the source of castor oil, which has a wide variety of uses. The seeds contain between 40% and 60% oil that is rich in triglycerides, mainly ricinolein. The seed also contains ricin, a water-soluble toxin, which is also present in lower concentrations throughout the plant.

        Ricin is derived from castor oil beans, some of which were found at the Wood Green flat. Ingested or inhaled as a fine dust, a dose of as little as 0.3 mg can be fatal. It affects the body's immune system so the victim suffers from infection that cannot be controlled and dies within days. The poison, which is tasteless and odourless, can be put in food and drink.
        recipe involved putting the beans in a solvent to break down the oils and fats, filtering the mixture and allowing it to form a powder. It was perfectly viable, said an expert who tested it on laboratory mice.
